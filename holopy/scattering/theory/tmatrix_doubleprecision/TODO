1. check polarisation - at the moment Tmatrix works if the input polarisation vector is [1,0]. Change S.lp.f to allow other polarisations.
2. why don't spheroid and ellipsoid work for DDA? indicators is messing up.
3. complete the tests for tmatrix
4. is a setup.py file necessary? probably not, but should check.
